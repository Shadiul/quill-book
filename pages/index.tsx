            Before then, I had been a biochemist at a chemical company and an
            agency at a start-up real-estate IT company. Curious and resourceful
            by nature, I love the process of discovering the problems and
            creating empowering experiences that can contribute to peopleâ€™s life
            to making the world a better place, no matter which field I stayed
            in.
